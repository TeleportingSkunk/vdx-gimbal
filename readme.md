# Two-Axis Camera Stabiliser w/ 9g Servos

Made during my internship at [Vision Dynamix](http://www.visiondynamix.com),  
this gimbal is intended for quad/hexacopter mounting. Using an ADXL335 breakout  
board and an Arduino Nano, the algorithm constantly drives the error signals  
to 0 by modulating the duration of the PWM impulses (in uS).
